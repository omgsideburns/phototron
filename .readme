# Phototron

A custom photo booth system built to replace the now-abandoned `pibooth` — because it doesn’t support current versions of Raspberry Pi OS, and honestly, it was starting to get a little clunky.

This is a homebrew solution using Node.js, Socket.IO, and whatever else I feel like bolting on. Designed to be touchscreen-friendly, print stuff reliably, and eventually support things like QR downloads and remote config.

More to come. This is mostly planning while I get the modules together.
