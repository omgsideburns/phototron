# Phototron

A custom photo booth system built to replace the now-abandoned `pibooth` — because it doesn’t support current versions of Raspberry Pi OS, and honestly, it was starting to get a little clunky.

This is a homebrew solution using whatever. Designed to be touchscreen-friendly, print stuff reliably, and eventually support things like QR downloads and remote config.

I am rebooting this specifically for Pi's at the moment because I'm in a time crunch to get it ready for an event...
