# Phototron

A custom photo booth system built to replace the now-abandoned `pibooth` â€” because it doesnâ€™t support current versions of Raspberry Pi OS, and honestly, it was starting to get a little clunky.

This is a homebrew solution using whatever. Designed to be touchscreen-friendly, print stuff reliably, and eventually support things like QR downloads and remote config.

I am rebooting this specifically for Pi's at the moment because I'm in a time crunch to get it ready for an event...

## Current Status

Under development again but not working yet...

I will push gits WAY too many times when I'm doing tests on a pi.  It's just so much easier to `git pull` updates rather than trying to transfer them directly between devices. 

Currently building in macos for Pi 4 or Pi 5.. hopefully will add crossplatform compatibility for funsies..

More to come. This is mostly planning while I get the modules together.

# ðŸ’¡ Phototron Light Animations

All animations live in `lights.py` under the `LightController` class. You can call them like this:

```python
from app.lights import LightController

lights = LightController()
lights.animate_party_mode()
```
